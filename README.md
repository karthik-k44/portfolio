Project Overview
This project serves as my personal portfolio website where I display my professional background, key projects, and contact information. It is designed to be a fully responsive, modern-looking site that can be adapted by others for their own portfolios.

Features
Responsive Design: Works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Showcase Projects: A section dedicated to listing and linking my projects.
Contact Form: Allows users to get in touch with me directly.
Modular Sections: Easy to modify and extend.
Clean and Simple UI: Focused on presenting content effectively without distractions.
Installation
Follow these instructions to set up the project locally on your machine:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
Git (optional, but useful for cloning the project)
A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text)

Clone the Repository
To download the project to your local machine, use Git to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git

Open the Project Locally

Usage
Once you have the project up and running, hereâ€™s what you can do:

Home Page: Displays an introduction, a brief bio, and links to other sections.
Projects: Lists my projects with links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
